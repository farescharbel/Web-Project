            <h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                Network infrastructure refers to the collection of technologies that allow communication between computing and storage, applications, and/or consumers. It encompasses physical network switches and routers, as well as virtualized network software for managing traffic flow. Network infrastructure also includes tools for monitoring and managing network availability and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                A stable network architecture is crucial for various use cases, including remote programs, device management, file distribution, and microservices communication. Network infrastructure offers functionalities for data transfer, performance enhancement, and security.

            <h2>History of the Web</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web (WWW) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN to address the need for automated information exchange among scientists globally. This international collaboration fostered the need for reliable communication mechanisms. The Web combined computers, data networks, and hypertext into a powerful information system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tim Berners-Lee's initial proposals for the Web were submitted in 1989 and 1990. By the end of 1990, he had built the first Web server and browser at CERN, demonstrating his concepts. The world's first website resided at info.cern.ch and can still be accessed through the original URL: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a>.

            <h2>Internet Statistics - Middle East and Lebanon</h2>
            <p>
                The Middle East is experiencing rapid digital transformation, with internet penetration rates reaching around 70% of the population. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are widely used. In Lebanon specifically, internet penetration is at 76%, highlighting the growing reliance on digital connectivity. However, challenges like regulations, digital literacy gaps, and infrastructure limitations remain. Efforts to address these issues are crucial for maximizing the digital era's socio-economic benefits in the region.
